# PSFree version 1.5.1

PSFree is a collection of exploits for the PS4 console. The main focus of the repo is for the PS4, but we try to make things portable to PS5.

## Features

- **Auto-detection:** Automatically detects console type and firmware version (via `src/config.mjs`).
- **WebKit Exploit (PSFree):** Entry point via the console's web browser.
- **Kernel Exploit (Lapse):** Escalates privileges to kernel level.
- **Payload Loader:** After successful kernel exploitation listens for a payload on port 9020.
