# PSFree version 1.5.0b with AIO Fix

Lapse Kex ported to 9.00

Very fast and reliable! Around 80% stability rate.

Update: I've added an payload having some process_dtor_handler patches related to aio bugs.. Now all games should work properly.. patches were made by abc for 8.0x and I ported to 9.00. Thx a lot to Sistro and CTN for some explanation on low level coding!!! :)

# HOW TO
* delete cache & Cookies and cache again. Note: this is still beta and it's only
for PS4 9.00fw.
* Only support PSfree + Lapse, should fix same bugs fixed by the GoldHEN plugin. if
you're on 900 and have plugin loader enabled, disable it or delete the plugin and
test this in host fix. Special thx to ABC, Sistro and CTN

PSFree is a collection of exploits for the PS4 console. The main focus of the 
repo is for the PS4 but we try to make things portable to PS5.
